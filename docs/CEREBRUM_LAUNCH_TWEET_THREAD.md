What is Cerebrum? 🤔

It's a smart layer over DeFi. We've built a beautiful, mobile-responsive UI that lets you interact with powerful AI agents. No more complex interfaces or dozens of tabs. Just a single, intuitive conversation.

Our backend is powered by @copilotkit, providing a robust and scalable foundation for our agent ecosystem.
