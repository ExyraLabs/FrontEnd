## 🏅 Rewards System (Beta)

The rewards system awards "Exyra Stones" for completing on-platform actions. It is implemented with Redux Toolkit (`src/store/rewardsSlice.ts`).

### Current Task Categories

- Social: Follow X, Join Discord, Join Telegram
- Chat: Send first message, Send 10 messages (progressive)
- DeFi (placeholders): First swap, First stake (dispatch appropriate actions after execution logic is wired)
- Referral: Invite friends (repeatable up to a configured cap)

### State Shape

```
rewards: {
  points: number,
  chatMessageCount: number,
  dailyMessageLimit: number,
  tasks: Record<taskId, { progress, completions, claimed, ...taskMeta }>,
  lastResetDate: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
}
```

### Key Actions

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `recordChatMessage()` | Increments daily message count & advances chat tasks |
| `completeSocialTask({ platform })` | Marks a social task completed after verification |
| `completeDefiAction({ actionType })` | Marks a DeFi task done (swap / stake etc) |
| `claimTask({ taskId })` | Grants points for a completed task |
| `checkDailyReset()` | Resets daily counters & chat tasks at UTC rollover |

### Integrating Future On-Chain Events

Call `dispatch(completeDefiAction({ actionType: 'swap' }))` (or `stake`, `bridge`, etc.) after a successful transaction confirmation. Then allow user to press "Claim" in the Rewards UI.

### Extending

Add new base tasks to the `baseTasks` array in `rewardsSlice.ts`. If progress-based, include `target` and initialize `progress: 0`.

### Persistence (Implemented)

Rewards progress now persists per wallet to MongoDB under `users.rewards`.

Components:
- Server actions: `getUserRewardsState`, `updateUserRewardsState` in `src/actions/rewards.ts`.
- Thunks: `loadRewardsFromDb(wallet)` (hydrate on connect), `saveRewardsToDb()` (serialize minimal shape).
- Middleware: Throttled (3s) autosave on reward-mutating actions; immediate save on claims.
- Hook: `useRewardIntegrations(wallet)` to mark social & DeFi tasks complete.

Stored shape:
```
rewards: {
  points,
  lastResetDate,
  chatMessageCount,
  tasks: { [taskId]: { progress, completions, claimed } }
}
```

To award on connect automatically, optionally call existing `addPoints` server action after platform auth then dispatch `claimTask`.
